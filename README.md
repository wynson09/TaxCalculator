This is an Assignment from Refocus.

The goal of this assignment is to create a monthly tax calculator. It should accept the user’s income and calculate their tax based on their set tax rate. Use components to develop it.

Additional Instruction:
Step 1
Make the input field accept only numeric values and limit the input to 7 digits.
Step 2
Use the “useState” hook to add a new state variable called “errorMessage
and a “setErrorMessage” function. Its initial value should be an empty string.
Step 3
For the “onClick” event handler, which you created in Task 1, check if the “income”
state variable is a valid number. If it isn’t, update the “errorMessage” state variable
to an error message saying, “Please input numbers only.” Make it red and display it
below the input field.
